  "implementation_summary": "Implemented buffer reset detection logic for Issue #59. Added detectBufferReset() function that detects two scenarios: (1) buffer shrink when currentLineCount is significantly smaller than lastCapturedLine with BUFFER_RESET_TOLERANCE=25, and (2) session restart when lastCapturedLine > 50 and currentLineCount < 50. The savePendingAssistantResponse() function now uses this detection to reset the effective last captured line to 0 when a buffer reset is detected, allowing responses to be saved correctly after session restarts or buffer clears. Added 23 new tests for detectBufferReset unit tests and 8 integration tests for savePendingAssistantResponse buffer reset scenarios.",
