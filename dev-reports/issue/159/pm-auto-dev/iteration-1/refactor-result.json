Version sections in InfoModal and MobileInfoContent match the styling conventions of adjacent sections (bg-gray-50 for desktop, bg-white with border for mobile). Tests are comprehensive with 4 cases covering desktop/mobile and version-set/unset scenarios. No refactoring improvements identified within Issue #159 scope.",
