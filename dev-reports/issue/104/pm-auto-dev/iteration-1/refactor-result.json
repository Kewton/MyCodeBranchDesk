  "summary": "Refactoring verification completed. The comments explaining the difference between containerClasses and containerStyle were already added during the TDD implementation phase. containerClasses applies 'fixed inset-0' only when isFallbackMode is true (CSS fallback for iOS Safari). containerStyle applies z-index for ALL maximized states (both native Fullscreen API and fallback mode) to ensure the editor appears above other UI elements like terminal tabs on iPad Chrome landscape.",
