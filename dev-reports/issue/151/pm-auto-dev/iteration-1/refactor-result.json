  "quality_assessment": "Good",
  "summary": "All four files were reviewed. Two minor improvements were made: (1) validators.sh now uses [[ ]] consistently for all conditionals, and (2) worktree-cleanup.md no longer uses emoji in code examples. The process-utils.sh file was already well-written with proper shebang, local variable declarations, quoted variables, [[ ]] conditionals, comprehensive documentation, and security audit logging. The worktree-setup.md file has emojis in output examples which are acceptable as they represent expected user-facing output rather than code.",
