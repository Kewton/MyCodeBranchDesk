  "quality_assessment": {
    "solid_compliance": "Good. Single Responsibility is well maintained across modules. auto-yes-manager handles state, auto-yes-resolver handles answer logic, API route handles HTTP, hook handles client-side integration.",
    "code_duplication": "Resolved. API route had duplicated worktree validation and response formatting; extracted into helper functions.",
    "type_safety": "Good. Strict types used throughout. AutoYesState, PromptData, and hook interfaces are well-defined.",
    "consistency": "Good. Follows existing codebase patterns (memo components, useCallback/useMemo hooks, error boundary wrapping)."
