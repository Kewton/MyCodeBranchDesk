  "implementation_summary": "Implemented dynamic polling intervals for worktree status updates. Added POLLING_INTERVALS constant with three tiers: PROCESSING (2s) for active processing or waiting for response, SESSION_RUNNING (5s) for running sessions without active processing, and IDLE (10s) for all idle worktrees. Replaced setInterval with setTimeout-based adaptive polling that determines the next interval based on current worktree states. Added 5 unit tests for the getPollingInterval function covering all scenarios.",
