    {
      "category": "code_style",

      "finding": "Code style is consistent with surrounding code. The isPathContinuation variable follows the same descriptive const pattern as hasLeadingSpaces and isShortFragment.",

      "category": "comments",
      "file": "src/lib/prompt-detector.ts",
      "finding": "Comments on lines 223-228 are accurate and complete. The four bullet points correctly describe the three conditions (third and fourth bullets map to the two parts of the isPathContinuation OR expression).",

    {
      "category": "code_smells",
      "file": "src/lib/prompt-detector.ts",
      "finding": "No code smells detected. The 3-condition OR (hasLeadingSpaces || isShortFragment || isPathContinuation) is simple and readable. Per YAGNI design policy, no additional abstraction is warranted.",

      "finding": "All 10 test cases have descriptive names and clear test data. Scope-limiting comments on lines 281-282 and 302 accurately describe what isPathContinuation covers vs. does not cover.",

      "category": "test_assertions",
      "file": "tests/unit/prompt-detector.test.ts",
      "finding": "No redundant assertions found. Each test verifies a distinct scenario: standard, wrapped options, tilde path, negative (no indicator), yes/no fallback, regression, wide terminal, path continuation, and multiple path continuations.",

  "message": "No refactoring needed. Code changes for Issue #181 are minimal, well-structured, and consistent with the existing codebase. Comments are accurate, test structure follows established patterns, and no code smells were detected. All 59 prompt-detector tests pass, ESLint reports 0 errors, and TypeScript type checking passes cleanly."
