  "message": "No refactoring changes needed. Code quality analysis found the implementation is clean, well-documented, and follows the design policy document accurately. Detailed findings: (1) Code comments in auto-yes-manager.ts lines 293-309 accurately reference IA-001, IA-002, IA-003, and SEC-C02 from the design doc. (2) THINKING_CHECK_LINE_COUNT constant is correctly placed in the Constants section with proper JSDoc including SF-001 cross-reference. (3) Windowing implementation (split-slice-join) follows KISS principle as documented in SF-002 design decision. (4) All 3 new tests follow existing patterns (dynamic imports, fake timers, proper cleanup) with sufficient assertions. Test 3 (SF-001) validates the semantic coupling between THINKING_CHECK_LINE_COUNT and prompt-detector.ts window size. (5) No code smells or unnecessary complexity detected. All 42 auto-yes-manager tests pass. TypeScript and ESLint checks pass with zero errors. Pre-existing test failure in claude-session.test.ts is unrelated to Issue #191."
