The 7 component tests (6 FileTreeView + 1 WorktreeDetailRefactored) fail due to a pre-existing environment issue where React is loaded in production mode, causing 'act(...) is not supported in production builds of React' for ALL jsdom-based component tests in the entire repository. This is confirmed by the parent repo (MyCodeBranchDesk) having the exact same failures for the same test files.",
  "message": "TDD implementation completed. 3 source files created/modified, 3 test files created/modified. 11 new tests fully pass (url-path-encoder). 7 new component tests correctly added but blocked by pre-existing React production mode environment issue affecting all component tests repo-wide."
