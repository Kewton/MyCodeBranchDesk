  "summary": "Issue #122 implementation is clean and follows best practices. No refactoring applied as the code quality is good, styling is consistent with context, and tests are comprehensive. Empty state buttons use appropriate standalone button styling distinct from context menu items, which is correct for their different usage contexts.",
