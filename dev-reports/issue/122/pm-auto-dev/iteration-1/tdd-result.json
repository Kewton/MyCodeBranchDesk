    "64c4d7d: feat(worktree): add New File/New Directory buttons to empty state"
  ],
  "summary": "TDD implementation completed successfully. Added 4 unit tests for empty state with action buttons feature. All tests pass. Implementation adds FilePlus and FolderPlus buttons to FileTreeView's empty state that appear when onNewFile/onNewDirectory callbacks are provided. Coverage is below 80% target but this is due to existing codebase coverage, not the new feature which is fully tested."
