  "summary": "Successfully fixed Issue #129 by changing the repository filter UI display condition from `repositories.length > 1` to `repositories.length > 0`. This single-line change allows users to see the repository filter UI and access the delete button when only one repository exists. All static analysis (ESLint, TypeScript) passes. Unit tests pass (minor worker error unrelated to change). Integration test failures are pre-existing and unrelated to this fix."
