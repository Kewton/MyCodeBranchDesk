    "S1-001/S1-002: Removed Section 3.2.1 (thinking check inside prompt-detector.ts). Thinking detection is now only in auto-yes-manager.ts (Section 3.2.2). Added design rationale for SRP/OCP/DRY maintenance.",
    "S1-001/S1-002: Updated Section 4 (multi-layer defense overview) to show Layer 1 thinking check is done at caller level, not inside prompt-detector.ts. Added per-caller annotations.",
    "S1-001/S1-002: Updated Section 2 (changed files table) to remove thinking detection from prompt-detector.ts scope. Added annotation note.",
    "S1-001/S1-002: Updated Section 8 (implementation order) to remove old Step 3 (prompt-detector.ts thinking detection).",
    "S1-003: Noted in Section 10.2 as out-of-scope technical debt with follow-up recommendation.",
    "S1-004: Updated Section 3.1 problem description to acknowledge L212 includes check already prevents space-only hasDefault=true. Clarified the real issue: broad pattern causes numbered lists to match as option lines in the options array.",
    "S1-004: Added design decision note to Section 3.1 modification approach explaining pattern separation benefits.",
    "S1-005: Downgraded consecutive number validation (Section 3.3) from Must to Should (defensive measure). Added annotation explaining actual false positive pattern is consecutive from 1. Updated Section 1.3 priority table.",
    "S1-005: Added defensive measure comment to isConsecutiveFromOne code sample.",
    "S1-006: Added status-detector.ts row to Section 7.1 impact analysis table with thinking judgment status column.",
    "S1-006: Added Section 7.2 analysis of status-detector.ts execution order issue (detectPrompt L80 early-returns before detectThinking L91).",
    "S1-006: Added Step 5 to Section 8 implementation order for status-detector.ts verification.",
    "S1-007: Added Section 5.3 with 5 boundary test cases covering each defense layer independently.",
    "S1-008: Noted claude-poller.ts thinkingPattern duplication in Section 10.2 as existing technical debt (out of scope).",
    "S1-009: Noted detectMultipleChoicePrompt function complexity in Section 10.2 as future refactoring candidate (out of scope).",
    "Added Section 10 (review findings summary) with complete findings table and out-of-scope technical debt table.",
    "Added Section 11 (implementation checklist) with Must Fix, Should Fix, and Test categories."
