  "changes_made": [
    "tests/unit/proxy/route.test.ts: Extracted createMockApp() and setupProxyMocks() helper functions to eliminate repeated mock app object and cache mock setup across 4 test cases (DRY principle)",
    "tests/unit/proxy/handler.test.ts: Removed unused http-proxy mock (vi.mock('http-proxy', ...)) that was dead code from a prior implementation; the current handler.ts uses native fetch, not http-proxy"
  ],
  "no_changes_needed": [
    "src/app/proxy/[...path]/route.ts: JSDoc and comments accurately describe the post-fix behavior; code is minimal and well-structured",
    "src/lib/proxy/handler.ts: JSDoc for path parameter correctly updated to 'full request path including proxy prefix'; buildUpstreamUrl comment correctly states upstream apps must configure basePath",
    "src/lib/proxy/logger.ts: JSDoc, examples, and log message format all correctly reflect the new path format; no redundant path construction",
    "tests/unit/proxy/logger.test.ts: Clean, comprehensive coverage with no duplication issues"

  ],
  "summary": "Minimal refactoring of test files only. Extracted common mock setup helpers in route.test.ts (reduced 107 lines of duplication to 50 lines via createMockApp/setupProxyMocks helpers) and removed dead http-proxy mock from handler.test.ts. No source file changes needed; all JSDoc and comments already accurately reflect the bug fix behavior. All 4097 tests pass, 0 lint errors, 0 type errors."
