  "summary": "The implementation for Issue #35 (dynamic polling interval) is clean and well-structured. The code follows SOLID principles (especially Single Responsibility and Open/Closed), KISS, and DRY. No refactoring changes were needed. The implementation correctly exports POLLING_INTERVALS constant and getPollingInterval function, both with comprehensive JSDoc documentation. The polling effect uses setTimeout for adaptive intervals based on worktree activity states. All tests pass with 97.1% coverage."
