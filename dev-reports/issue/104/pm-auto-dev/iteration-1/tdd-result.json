  ],
  "summary": "TDD implementation completed for Issue #104. Fixed iPad Chrome landscape mode bug where markdown editor was not appearing above terminal tabs when maximized. The root cause was z-index only being applied in CSS fallback mode, but iPad Chrome uses the native Fullscreen API (isFallbackMode=false). Changed condition from 'isMaximized && isFallbackMode' to just 'isMaximized' so z-index is always set when maximized. Added 3 unit tests covering both API and fallback modes. All static analysis checks passed."
